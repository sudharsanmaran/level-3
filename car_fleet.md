### Problem: Car Fleets with Variable Destinations, Starting Times, Dynamic Speed Limits, and Conditional Overtaking

**Description:**

You are given `n` cars, each with a starting position, speed, and target destination. Each car may have a unique destination, and cars can group into fleets when they reach the same speed or catch up to each other. However, overtaking is only allowed in specific sections of the road. Additionally, there are dynamic speed limits along the road, forcing all cars to adjust their speed accordingly when passing through those sections.

The problem is to determine how many car fleets will reach their respective destinations, considering the following conditions:
1. **Variable Target Destinations**: Each car has its own target destination. Cars can only form fleets with other cars traveling to the same destination.
2. **Variable Starting Times**: Cars do not start at the same time. A `start_time[i]` array determines when each car starts moving.
3. **Dynamic Speed Limits**: There are segments of the road where the speed is restricted, and cars must slow down to match the speed limit.
4. **Overtaking Allowed in Particular Sections**: Cars can overtake only in specific sections of the road, and after overtaking, they move ahead of the slower cars.

### Case 1: Overtaking in Allowed Sections, Different Destinations

**Input:**

- `target = [12, 15, 12, 20]` (each car has a different destination)
- `position = [10, 8, 5, 2]`
- `speed = [2, 4, 3, 5]`
- `start_time = [0, 0, 2, 3]` (cars 1 and 2 start at time 0, car 3 at time 2, car 4 at time 3)
- Dynamic speed limits:  `speed_limit = [(3, 7, 3)]` (between miles 3 and 7, all cars are limited to speed 3)
- Overtaking is allowed between miles 8 and 10.

**Explanation:**

- **Initial Setup**:
  - Car 1 starts at mile 10 with a speed of 2, aiming for target mile 12.
  - Car 2 starts at mile 8 with a speed of 4, aiming for target mile 15.
  - Car 3 starts at mile 5 at time 2 with a speed of 3, aiming for target mile 12.
  - Car 4 starts at mile 2 at time 3 with a speed of 5, aiming for target mile 20.

- **Dynamic Speed Limits**:
  - Between miles 3 and 7, the speed limit is 3. This impacts car 4 since it will pass through this section at a higher speed.

- **Overtaking**:
  - Car 2 and car 1 approach mile 8 and 10. Car 2, with a higher speed (4 vs. 2), overtakes car 1 in the allowed section (miles 8-10) and moves ahead. Since car 2 is heading for mile 15 and car 1 for mile 12, they will not form a fleet.

- **Fleet Formation**:
  - Car 1 reaches its destination (mile 12) without forming a fleet.
  - Car 2 continues towards mile 15 and will not form a fleet.
  - Car 3, which starts at time 2 from mile 5, catches up to car 1 due to a higher speed but is restricted by the speed limit. They both slow down to 3 mph but do not form a fleet since they are not overtaking and heading for different destinations.

- **Outcome**:
  - Cars 1 and 3 form separate fleets because of different destinations.
  - Car 2 forms its own fleet due to overtaking and a different target.
  - Car 4 does not catch up to any other car and forms its own fleet.

**Output**: 4 fleets (Car 1, Car 2, Car 3, and Car 4 each form separate fleets)

### Case 2: Fleet Forming at Dynamic Speed Limits and Overtaking

**Input:**

- `target = [10, 10, 10, 10]` (all cars have the same destination)
- `position = [5, 7, 2, 9]`
- `speed = [3, 5, 2, 1]`
- `start_time = [0, 1, 0, 3]`
- Dynamic speed limits: `speed_limit = [(4, 8, 2)]` (between miles 4 and 8, all cars are limited to speed 2)
- Overtaking allowed between miles 6 and 10.

**Explanation**:

- **Initial Setup**:
  - Car 1 starts at mile 5 with speed 3, heading to mile 10.
  - Car 2 starts at mile 7 with speed 5 at time 1, heading to mile 10.
  - Car 3 starts at mile 2 with speed 2, heading to mile 10.
  - Car 4 starts at mile 9 with speed 1 at time 3, heading to mile 10.

- **Dynamic Speed Limits**:
  - Between miles 4 and 8, the speed limit is 2. All cars passing through this section must slow down to 2 mph.

- **Overtaking**:
  - Car 1 and Car 2 approach the speed limit zone between miles 4 and 8. Car 2 catches up to Car 1, but both are restricted to a speed of 2 mph. Overtaking is allowed between miles 6 and 10. Car 2 overtakes Car 1 after passing mile 8 and continues toward the target.
  - Car 3, which is slower, enters the speed limit zone but does not catch up with Car 1 and Car 2 before they reach mile 8.
  - Car 4, with the slowest speed, doesnâ€™t catch up to any other cars and forms its own fleet.

- **Fleet Formation**:
  - Cars 1 and 2 form one fleet after the overtaking, as they reach the target at similar times.
  - Car 3 forms a fleet of its own since it doesn't catch up with Car 1 or 2.
  - Car 4, which started late and is slow, forms its own fleet.

**Outcome**:
- Cars 1 and 2 form one fleet because of overtaking and similar speeds after the limit.
- Car 3 and Car 4 form separate fleets.

**Output**: 3 fleets (Cars 1 & 2 form one fleet, Cars 3 and 4 form separate fleets).

These cases demonstrate how the added conditions affect the formation of fleets based on target destinations, overtaking sections, speed limits, and starting times. The solutions consider when overtaking is allowed and how speed limits influence when cars can merge into fleets or remain separate.
