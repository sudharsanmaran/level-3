### Problem Description

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, along with grouping information. Tasks can belong to different groups, and tasks from the same group cannot be run consecutively. Additionally, tasks from the same group have group-based cooling times, meaning you must wait for at least `n` intervals before executing another task from the same group, even if the tasks are different. Tasks also have different durations, specifying how long each task takes to complete. Moreover, within each group, certain tasks might depend on the completion of another task, limiting their execution order.

**Objective**: Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks, considering the group-based cooling times, task durations, and dependencies.

### Problem Details

1. **Task Grouping**: 
   Tasks are divided into different groups. If two tasks belong to the same group, they must be separated by a specified cooling time `n`, regardless of whether the tasks are the same or different.
   
2. **Cooling Time**: 
   For tasks within the same group, a cooldown of `n` intervals is required between the execution of any two tasks from that group.
   
3. **Task Duration**: 
   Each task has a different execution duration, which represents the number of CPU intervals required to complete that task. If a task has a duration `d`, it will occupy `d` CPU intervals consecutively before another task can be started.
   
4. **Dependencies**: 
   Some tasks within the same group depend on the completion of another task. A task can only be executed after its dependent task has finished.

### Input Format
- `tasks`: An array of tuples where each tuple contains a task label (A-Z), group name, task duration, and task dependency (if any).
- `cooldown`: A dictionary where the key is the group name, and the value is the cooling time `n` for that group.

### Output Format
- Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks, respecting the conditions on grouping, cooling time, task duration, and dependencies.

### Test Case 1:

**Input**:
```plaintext
tasks = [
    ("A", "group1", 2, None),  # Task A in group1 with duration 2 and no dependencies
    ("B", "group1", 1, "A"),   # Task B in group1 with duration 1 and depends on A
    ("C", "group2", 3, None),  # Task C in group2 with duration 3 and no dependencies
    ("D", "group2", 2, None)   # Task D in group2 with duration 2 and no dependencies
]
cooldown = {
    "group1": 2,  # Cooling time of 2 intervals between tasks in group1
    "group2": 1   # Cooling time of 1 interval between tasks in group2
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Task A from `group1` must be executed first because Task B depends on Task A.
- Task B in `group1` can only be executed after Task A and must be separated by at least 2 intervals due to the cooldown.
- Task C and Task D from `group2` are independent, but there must be at least 1 interval between them because they are in the same group.
  
**Possible sequence**:
- Step 1-2: A (duration 2)
- Step 3-5: idle (cooldown for `group1`)
- Step 6: B (duration 1)
- Step 7-9: C (duration 3)
- Step 10: idle (cooldown for `group2`)
- Step 11-12: D (duration 2)

**Total CPU intervals**: 12

### Test Case 2:

**Input**:
```plaintext
tasks = [
    ("X", "group1", 1, None),  # Task X in group1 with duration 1 and no dependencies
    ("Y", "group1", 2, "X"),   # Task Y in group1 with duration 2 and depends on X
    ("Z", "group1", 1, None),  # Task Z in group1 with duration 1 and no dependencies
    ("P", "group2", 2, None),  # Task P in group2 with duration 2 and no dependencies
    ("Q", "group2", 1, "P")    # Task Q in group2 with duration 1 and depends on P
]
cooldown = {
    "group1": 3,  # Cooling time of 3 intervals between tasks in group1
    "group2": 2   # Cooling time of 2 intervals between tasks in group2
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Task X from `group1` must be executed first because Task Y depends on X.
- After executing Task X, we need a cooldown of 3 intervals for `group1`.
- Task Y from `group1` can only be executed after the cooldown, and after Y, another 3-interval cooldown is required before Task Z.
- Task P from `group2` must be executed before Task Q due to the dependency, and a cooldown of 2 intervals is required after Task P before Task Q can be executed.

**Possible sequence**:
- Step 1: X (duration 1)
- Step 2-4: idle (cooldown for `group1`)
- Step 5-6: Y (duration 2)
- Step 7-9: idle (cooldown for `group1`)
- Step 10: Z (duration 1)
- Step 11-12: P (duration 2)
- Step 13-14: idle (cooldown for `group2`)
- Step 15: Q (duration 1)

**Total CPU intervals**: 15

### Summary of Problem Mechanics:
1. **Grouping**: Tasks are divided into groups. Tasks from the same group must be separated by a group-specific cooling time.
2. **Cooling Time**: If two tasks belong to the same group, they must be separated by `n` intervals, even if they are different tasks.
3. **Task Duration**: Each task has a different duration, indicating how many CPU intervals it occupies.
4. **Dependencies**: Some tasks can only be executed after a certain task in the same group has been completed.
   
These rules make scheduling tasks more complex, requiring careful handling of dependencies, durations, and cooling periods to minimize the number of CPU intervals.
